I'm currently trying to find an extension for controlling the speed with the range or has the parameters set were you able to go all the way to 0.0. 
I used to have one but haven't been able to find that specific one again, and all the one's looked at recently only go as low as .07 or .25. If anyone
knows of one or is willing to show and teach me within in the code of one of the extensions I already where the range for those parameters is set i would appreciate
